		<h4>What I Hope to Learn From This Class</h6>
		<p>
		I want to know more about servers. I have set up servers to play games with friends, but I have yet to create a website with content stored on a remote server. I want to know how the backend works. Once I learn that, I hope to create my own website where I can store anything I want on a remote server and access it anywhere.

		<h4>An Interesting and Unique Experience</h6>
		<p>
		When I was 12, my parents got me a bow and a quiver of arrows. I would go out into the backyard and practice my aim on empty, aluminum soda cans. I was not a good archer, and I would take several shots to hit a single can. When I did hit one, the can would get a very obvious hole straight through it. My arrows had dull, practice tips to make sure I didn't hurt anyone, but the soda cans were very weak. One time the arrow hit the can but kept going, hit the fence, shot upward, and landed directly on top of the fence. I was very lucky it didn't go into the neighbor's backyard otherwise I might have broken something.
