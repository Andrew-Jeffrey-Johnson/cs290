		<h1>27 April 2020 CSS</h1>
		<h3><a href="index2.html">Assignment 2</a></h3>
		<p>This is the second assignment of CS290. This assignment focused solely on CSS. I already knew the basics of CSS and a few of the style properties. However, I never had to recreate a website using GIFs and pictures. The most difficult part of this assignment was looking at the mocks and taking several guesses on what CSS property the original used. Because of this, I had learned about new properties like sticky navigations and relative positioning, neither of them I used. Also because of this, I learned about flexboxes, which is completely new to me, and I used it a lot. I tried doing online searches to figure out how to use flexboxes, but the search results were never solved my issues with everything scaling the wrong way. Piazza helped me solve a few issues, such as avoiding the use of position:relative for everything aligned on the right side, but the lecture notes saved me almost every time. The notes included everything I needed plus hints on which properties to use or not to use. Because of this I avoided using float for the navigation bar and the twits. Overall, this assignment went well for me. I'll be sure to continue referencing the notes for when I need help.</p>
		<h1>8 April 2020 First Beginnings with Git and GitHub</h1>
		<h3><a href="index.html">Assignment 1</a></h3>
		<p>This is the first assignment of CS290. Overall, this assignment went smoothly. I already have knowledge with HTML and CSS, and I was able to recall all the details with a few web searches. All the issues I had were with Git and GitHub. I have never used either of them before this assignment. When I was just getting started on my project, I kept messing up with some command and needing to get another copy of the folder from GitHub. I tried reading about what I was doing wrong, but no sources helped. However, I rewatched the recorded lecutures and was able to figure out my mistake. Apparently, the reason why my files were not showing up after in the GitHub repository after I commit them is because I need to push them after I commit them. Looking back, this is a silly error, but I seriously had trouble with it for the longest time. Seeing every step in the process during the lecture helped me understand. If I get stuck in the future, I'll remember to watch the lectures.</p>
